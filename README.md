•	Many CEOs may overestimate AI's capabilities, leading to unrealistic project expectations.
### Feasibility of AI Projects
•	Predicting stock prices based solely on historical data is not feasible due to the randomness of the stock market.
•	Successful AI applications often require additional data inputs beyond historical prices to improve predictive power.
### Guidelines for Selecting AI Projects
•	Simpler concepts that require less mental effort are more likely to be feasible for AI implementation.
•	Having a large dataset for both inputs and outputs increases the chances of successfully building a machine learning system.


### In supervised learning, the key components include:

Labeled Data: This means that the input data (features) is paired with the correct output (labels). For example, in a dataset of images of cats and dogs, each image would be labeled as either "cat" or "dog."

Learning Process: The algorithm learns from this labeled data to make predictions on new, unseen data. It tries to find patterns that relate the input to the output.

Evaluation: After training, the model is tested on a separate set of data to see how well it predicts the outcomes.
In contrast, unsupervised learning does not use labeled data. Instead, it tries to find patterns or groupings in the data without any specific output to guide it.

## Week 2

### Key Steps in a Machine Learning Project

Collect Data: Gather audio recordings of people saying the target word (e.g., "Alexa") and other words for comparison.
Train the Model: Use a machine learning algorithm to learn the mapping from audio input to the expected output, iterating multiple times to improve accuracy.
Deployment and Iteration

### Deploy the Model: Implement the trained model in a smart device and release it to users. Monitor its performance with real-world data.
Iterate for Improvement: Use feedback and new data to refine the model, addressing issues like regional accents that may affect recognition.

### Application to Other Projects

Self-Driving Cars Example: Similar steps apply, such as collecting images and their corresponding outputs (e.g., car positions) to train the model for detecting vehicles.

### Key Steps in a Data Science Project

Data Collection: Gather data on user interactions, such as website visits and geographical information, to understand user behavior.
Data Analysis: Analyze the collected data to identify factors affecting performance, such as shipping costs or seasonal shopping trends.

### Application of Data Science in Manufacturing

Data Collection: Collect data on manufacturing processes, including material properties and environmental conditions, to monitor production quality.
Data Analysis: Use insights from the data to optimize manufacturing processes, reducing defects and improving efficiency.
Overall, the key steps of a data science project involve collecting data, analyzing it, suggesting hypotheses and actions, and continuously reanalyzing new data to enhance outcomes.

### Due Diligence for AI Projects

Technical Diligence: Assess the feasibility of the AI system by consulting experts and reviewing literature to determine if the desired performance levels are achievable.
Business Diligence: Evaluate the potential value of the project for the business, including cost savings and revenue generation, often using financial models to quantify benefits.

### Ethical Considerations

Ethical Diligence: Consider the societal impact of the AI project to ensure it contributes positively to humanity, alongside technical and business evaluations.

### Build vs. Buy Decision

In-House vs. Outsourcing: Decide whether to build AI solutions internally or outsource them, noting that data science projects are often better done in-house due to their close ties to business operations.
Industry Standards: Avoid building solutions that are industry standards; instead, leverage existing solutions to focus resources on unique projects that provide a competitive advantage.
This structured approach helps identify promising AI projects and ensures that resources are allocated effectively.

### Understanding Acceptance Criteria

Clearly specify acceptance criteria for the project, such as achieving a certain accuracy level (e.g., 95% accuracy in defect detection).
Provide a dataset for measuring performance, known as a test set, which should include labeled images for evaluation.

### Data Organization in AI Projects

AI teams utilize two main datasets: the training set (for learning) and the test set (for evaluation).
The training set consists of labeled examples that help the AI learn the mapping from input (images) to output (labels).
